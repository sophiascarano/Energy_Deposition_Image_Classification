    "### My Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "I plan to compare the results of using a convolutional neural network and using a capsule network to classify energy deposition images of five particle types using data provided in Deep Learn Physics http://deeplearnphysics.org/DataChallenge/. I will use model accuracy to assess performance. If I find that investigating the capsule network is too difficult, I will stick with a convolutional neural network, and will do the capsule network on my own after the course ends. One of the most enticing aspects with using this data is that the Deep Learn Physics group has proposed a challenge where I can contact them to share my result, and be a part of an informal competition. I understand that this data is from 2017, but even if the challenge has ended, itâ€™s still interesting data and heavily connects with my physics background. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why capsule networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why not just convolutional neural networks? \n",
    "- Here, we have data of particle trajectories\n",
    "- These trajectories could be coming in at an infinite number of angles to the dataset\n",
    "    - These trajectories are in a voxelized 3D data in a 2D format.\n",
    "    - In 3D computer graphics, a voxel represents a value on a regular grid in three-dimensional space. The word voxel originated analogously to the word \"pixel\", with vo representing \"volume\" and el representing \"element\"; similar formations with el for \"element\" include the words \"pixel\" and \"texel\" \n",
    "- A convolutional neural network needs to be trained explicitly on all possible combinations of training images so that it learns on all of them.\n",
    "    - Yes, Image Augmentation exists (which modifies, rotates, inverts, etc. the data) to generate every possible combination, but is very computationally expensive.\n",
    "    - CNNs can handle translational invariance but cannot handle rotational invariance (source: https://analyticsindiamag.com/why-do-capsule-networks-work-better-than-convolutional-neural-networks/)\n",
    "- MaxPooling does not provide 'ViewPoint invariance': the ability to make the model invariant to changes in viewpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "Why capsule networks?\n",
    "- Use Dynamic routing in place of max pooling layer in CNN:\n",
    "    - Outperforms CNNs when it comes to problems of viewpoint invariance\n",
    "    - could be useful for different incoming particle trajectories\n",
    "- Use 'heirarchy of parts' method\n",
    "    - Could have each of these five trajectory types be classified as a 'part'"
